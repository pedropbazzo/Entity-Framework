# Sample - Oracle Provider

Since 3.0 is a major release with significant breaking changes, the cost of keeping Oracle Provider Sample up-to-date and working is high. Hence it has been removed from master branch. We plan to bring it back before 3.0 RTM. You can track the work through this [issue](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/14175).

You can find the last available version of Oracle Provider Sample [here](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/tree/10780cd69185dea4b5b8a72a631a7010eab4f5f6/samples/OracleProvider)
